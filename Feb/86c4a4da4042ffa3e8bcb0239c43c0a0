It took about  four hours on Sunday for Tshwane firefighters to negotiate and rescue a naked  and allegedly suicidal man  at a Virgin Active building in Sunnyside, Pretoria. The incident unfolded throughout Sunday afternoon when Tshwane emergency services received information about a man on the gym club’s rooftop “threatening to stab himself with a broken bottle if anyone came close to him”. According to Tshwane EMS spokesperson Charles Mabaso, the  man is believed to have been under the influence of narcotics. “ A firefighter managed to convince the man to come down after 7pm and he was handed over to the police. The scene had been ongoing from around 3pm.” . Mabaso said the man  was handed over to  police as  standard procedure and for his own safety. TimesLIVE

Stage 4 load-shedding will be implemented until 4pm on Monday afternoon and stage 5 until 5am on Tuesday morning.

Electricity imports from the Cahora Bassa hydro scheme in Mozambique have been halved to 6OOMW due to a tower failure on one  line from that country. Over the weekend a generating unit each at the Arnot, Grootvlei, Kendal, Medupi and Tutuka power stations were returned to service. However, breakdowns of a unit each at Camden, Majuba and Matimba power stations caused units to be taken offline for repairs. Delays in returning a unit each to service at Arnot, Hendrina, Kendal, Medupi and Tutuka power stations are contributing to the  capacity constraints. Four open-cycle gas turbines at Ankerlig  station are out of service until March 15 for planned maintenance. Breakdowns  amount to 16,870MW of generating capacity and 4,757MW of generating capacity is out of service for planned maintenance. TimesLIVE

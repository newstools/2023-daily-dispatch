Several roads in the southern parts of Kruger National Park have been closed due to heavy rains. Visitors cannot access the Crocodile River Bridge Gate and the Malelane Gate due to  flooding of the river and several  bridges are  under water. South African National Parks spokesperson Ike Phaahla said guests are advised not to  travel on  roads which have been closed and not to cross  low-water bridges as the danger of being washed away  is high. Visitors are also asked to stay on  tar  and  avoid gravel roads. “The rain forecast for today [Thursday]  is high. Caution should be exercised at all times on the roads. “Guests who need to postpone their booking  will be given the option of an immediate date change or a credit on their profile to use at a later date." For  enquiries, visitors can contact  camps directly or the  park administration offices  on 013-735-4000. TimesLIVE

South African Tourism  briefed  media on Thursday after reports emerged of a proposed three-year sponsorship deal with English Premier League football club Tottenham Hotspur worth nearly R1bn. SA Tourism acting CEO Themba Khumalo said the proposed deal is aimed at attracting tourists to  boost  economic recovery. “We believe  tourism is one of the biggest economic drivers and will continue to increase its influence and its impact on the economy,” he said. LISTEN HERE: The decision has been met with  anger from some South Africans, who say there are better ways to spend the money as the country faces  many socioeconomic challenges. The DA and ActionSA are among those who have  criticised the deal. Khumalo said it was nothing new for SA Tourism to spend millions of rand in foreign marketing  and  it had been done in previous years. No  contract had yet been signed  but the deal had been “partially” approved by the SA Tourism board, he said. TimesLIVE

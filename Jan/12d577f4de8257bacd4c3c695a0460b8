 Tension erupted in Mdantsane’s NU9 on Friday afternoon when police fired rubber bullets to disperse an angry crowd that had gathered at a house suspected to be the scrapyard where cables stolen from Cecilia Makiwane Hospital (CMH) were sold. Police arrived on Friday as the local crime forum led a raid on the house, which was broadcast on live TV. The drama started on Thursday evening when the forum apprehended two suspects believed to be the ones who stole cables on Tuesday. They were beaten up and taken to the  same hospital they are suspected of stealing from. Provincial health spokesperson Yonela Dekeda said the two injured suspects were brought to Cecilia Makiwane’s casualty unit by the forum. Both  are  in a stable condition. CMH was up and running by Friday and a preliminary report indicated  the perpetrators had dug a hole under the fence to gain entry to the facility, according to Dekeda. Health MEC Nomakhosazana Meth, who was on an oversight visit to the hospital on Thursday, condemned cable theft. “We need our communities to take ownership of government property because they will  suffer when services are disrupted. The people who stole the cables live among us in our communities. “We are calling on community forums, communities and everyone to work together to ensure that such criminal elements are rooted out by exposing the thugs behind such criminality. “We are fortunate that this time no lives were lost as a result of this thuggery, because we moved with speed to ensure that a contractor was appointed to fix the cables while critical patients were moved to other hospitals.

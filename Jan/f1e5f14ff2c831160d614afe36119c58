Listen to what he has to say: Expelled  ANC member Carl Niehaus will  host a Twitter Spaces tonight at 7pm  where listeners  will engage with him on his proposed “political movement”. Niehaus recently announced his intention to form a “political movement”  aimed at furthering the goals of the radical economic transformation agenda in  South Africa.In an  interview with TimesLIVE, Niehaus, who was a member of the ANC for 43-years,  said his proposed  movement stems from what he  perceives to be the ANC’s failure to live up to  core ideologies upon which the party was formed. Niehaus was expelled  last month after a disciplinary hearing in which he “failed to show remorse”. He tendered his “resignation” from the ANC two weeks later. At the time he said his expulsion was suspended as he had filed an application to appeal the decision. In this interview Niehaus is particularly critical of President Cyril Ramaphosa and what he considers to be Ramaphosa’s role in “liberalising” the ANC to make it more palatable for “white monopoly capital”. He  outlines his distaste for Ramaphosa and the direction the ANC has taken under  his leadership. “Ultimately, I believe my fellow comrades in the ANC will see the way and eventually leave the party,” he said.

The information was operationalised and the suspects' vehicles were noticed on Olifantsfontein Road in Glen Austin. “Realising the team was about to pounce, the suspects fired shots and a high-speed chase and shoot-out ensued.” Mogale said four suspects were fatally wounded and two suffered minor injuries which were attended to at the scene. “The truck is reported to have been couriering electronic devices. Two unlicensed firearms were recovered at the scene. The four vehicles used by the suspects  have questionable origins which are under investigation.” The  suspects will appear in court soon.

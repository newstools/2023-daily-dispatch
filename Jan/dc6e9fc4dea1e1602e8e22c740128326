Cecilia Makiwane Hospital in Mdantsane experienced power outages  after it was hit by cable thieves this week. “The department discovered that the cables that supply power to the hospital were badly vandalised and  portions of the cables were stolen, Eastern Cape health  spokesperson Yonela Dekeda said on Wednesday. “A contractor is  on site for repairs and replacement of the stolen cables, with the repair work expected to be concluded before the end of business today. “As an interim measure, the facility is operating with two generators.” The department condemned the “senseless act of vandalism”. It appealed to the public to refrain from tampering with and damaging government resources that were supposed to save people’s lives. “Such acts may cause unnecessary damage and could lead  to loss of life,” Dekeda said. “In this  instance, we can fortunately report that there has been no adverse event  to date. “We  request the public not to panic and further reassure our communities that the matter is receiving urgent attention. “The matter has been reported to the police for investigation.” DispatchLIVE​

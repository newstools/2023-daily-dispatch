The DA has encouraged the public to bid for Tsotsi actress Terry Pheto’s house  after it went on auction this week. The award-winning actress’ lavish Bryanston home, allegedly bought with National Lotteries Commission (NLC) funds, was put up for auction to recoup funds allegedly obtained fraudulently. The opening bid was listed as R4m. After no offers were made by the 28 registered bidders, it was reduced to R2.5m. “The DA encourages members of the public to bid for ‘Lottopreneur’ and award-winning actress Terry Pheto’s  house,” said the party “Despite her initial ‘dismay’ about the revelation that she had allegedly unduly benefited from lotteries funding meant for culturally sensitive medical intervention projects, the SIU Special Investigating Unit (SIU) has stated  she and her legal team have chosen not to oppose the preservation order.” The party said it strongly supports what will be done with the proceedings from the auction. “The proceedings instituted by the SIU are an ongoing process to recover ill-gotten gains and the DA is strongly in support of this. However, we call on the National Prosecuting Authority  to prosecute Pheto and others who have allegedly been implicated in stealing from the poor.” The three-storey home has three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a kitchen, an open-plan dining room, a family room and a lounge. The third bedroom can be used as a study or office. It also has a large rooftop garden with an entertainment area, and a double garage. Speaking on SABC News, SIU spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago said: “There were no takers unfortunately. There were people who registered, about 28 people, but none of them put an offer on it, which is a very strange thing. The house is  available. “What’s going to happen  is they will find other ways of dealing with the sale. All  we want is the money back so  we can take that money back to the lottery and  it is used for what it was intended for.”

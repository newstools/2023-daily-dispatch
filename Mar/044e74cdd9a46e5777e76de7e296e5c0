Healthcare practitioners from the South African Defence Force  were deployed to Thelle Mogoerane Hospital on Monday. According to health minister Joe Phaahla, 20 nurses are  helping to alleviate pressure amid a wage strike by the National Education, Health and Allied Workers' Union (Nehawu). Hospital CEO Dr Michael Malaka said the  facility had been severely  affected by intimidation and absenteeism amid  the wage strike which  started on March 6. Hospitals affected by the strike are expected to  stabilise after a court interdict by the Labour Appeal Court. The court  ruled Nehawu and  essential service employees were restrained and prevented from continuing with or participating in strike action with immediate effect from Monday afternoon. TimesLIVE
